SOLID principles are object-oriented design concepts relevant to software development.
SOLID is an acronym for five other class-design principles:

1. Single Responsibility Principle,
2. Open-Closed Principle,
3. Liskov Substitution Principle,
4. Interface Segregation Principle, and
5. Dependency Inversion Principle.

### History of SOLID Principles in Java

Robert C. Martin gave five object-oriented design principles, and the acronym “S.O.L.I.D” is used for it. When you use all the principles of S.O.L.I.D in a combined manner, it becomes easier for you to develop software that can be managed easily. The other features of using S.O.L.I.D are:

- It avoids code smells.
- Quickly refractor code.
- Can do adaptive or agile software development.
